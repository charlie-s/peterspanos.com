                        A lifelong soccer player, Peter Spanos saw an opportunity to use his athletic background as a platform for teaching life skills. From that vision, he founded Vetta Sports, an organization offering year-round amateur sports leagues and programs.

                        Peter, along with his brother John, has grown Vetta Sports from a single location in 1988 to today's well recognized networks of facilities. Vetta Sports currently serves over two million visitors annually. Demonstrating Peter's leadership and charisma, Vetta's executive team has been with him for over 20 years.

                        Continually searching for ways to improve the community, Peter was the Founding Board Chairman of America Scores – St. Louis, a youth program which combines soccer and writing as a method for promoting teamwork and academics. Additionally, Peter played a vital role in the construction of a new family life center and the renovation of an existing sanctuary at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church.
